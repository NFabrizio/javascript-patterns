# JavaScript Patterns - Singletons

This is a simple JavaScript singleton example. It is set up using a JavaScript class and
all the ES2015 goodness.

## Installation and Set Up  
Below are the instructions for setting up this example.
*These instructions are valid as of 2017.12.01*

### Environment Set Up  
1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
  1. Fork this Github repo.
    1. In a web browser, visit https://github.com/NFabrizio/javascript-patterns
    2. Click the Fork button in the upper right corner of the screen
    3. In the "Where should we fork this repository?" pop up, select your username.
    Github should create a fork of the repo in your account
  2. Clone your fork of the javascript-patterns repo.
    1. In the terminal on your local environment, navigate to the directory where
    you want to clone the javascript-patterns repo  
      `cd ~/path/to/your/directory`
    2. In the terminal, run:  
      `git clone [clone-url-for-your-fork]`  
      The URL should be in the format git@github.com:YourUsername/javascript-patterns.git
2. Open the singletons/index.html file in your web browser on your local machine.

## Application Use  
Open the singletons/index.html file in your web browser on your local machine. Since
this is an example of a Javascript pattern, it is not set up to display anything
in the browser. The real magic happens in the developer tools console panel, so
open the developer tools by either right clicking somewhere on the web page and
selecting "Inspect" or by using the keyboard shortcut command + option + J (for
Mac users). You should see the data from the console logs in the Console panel
of the developer tools window.
